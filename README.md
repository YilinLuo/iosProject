# iosProject

Currently, i'm setting up the UI flow of this project. The MainPage has a MapView, a Search Bar, a tableView (that presents top rated user entries), and a tab bar (that has 3 buttons: myDiary, LookUp, and Feed). I have not built the segues yet, but the idea is that, clicking on LookUp leads to a new controllerView that shows a search bar and matching search results; clicking on MyDiary shows user's personal entries presneted on a table view- each list item is clickable and shows an entire entry on click (Master-detail view?); clicking on Feed will show other users' entries.
